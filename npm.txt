- npm=node package manager

-node related all packages included in npm

- node js core mai install hoke ata hai woh module kehelate hai
- aur jo hum npm se download karte hai use kehte hai package

// installing and uninstalling anything
- npm i / npm install

//uninstall 
npm uninstall package_name
for ex- npm uninstall accessibility


//installing particular version of package
- npm install accessibility@3.0.9

- so basically npm is used for installing,uninstalling and for managing the dev dependencies

//dependencies- packages and packages ki dependencies
// dev dependencies-  packages which are only used in development.then when the app is ready and deployed then we will not be using this dependencies
- npm i nodemon --save-dev

so this nodemon will be installed first as a dependency but after running above line it will be treated as dev dependency it will only used in development then after deploy it will be not used

//start and test
npm start
npm test
- they are inbuild scripts...in package.json file under scripts tag there test: if we run npm test then it will run...if we write there start:"node './script.js"
and run npm start it will run the file means we don't have to mention node script.js instead only npm start it will work
but let's say we define user generated script
for ex- chinu:'echo\"Hello\"'
then we have to mention npm run chinu for output

-these scripts can be helpful when we have to run two servers simultaneously let's say one for react and one for node (mern stack)
